<h1>Crafting Azeroth Style Guide</h1>

Below is a brief list of guidelines for editing the Crafting Azeroth map.

<h2>DO NOT:</h2>

<ul>

<li><u><b>Do not</b> alter the alignment of structures</u>. Some buildings are placed at odd angles, this is the reality of the map. Do <i>not</i> attempt to change this by rebuilding structures at 90 degree angles. Instead, preserve the existing alignment of buildings and make other, less drastic changes to improve building aesthetics.</li> 
<br>
<li><u><b>Do not</b> remove details from the map</u>. Some objects are poorly rendered by the algorithm; you should work to improve these details, but you should not remove them. Try to preserve as much of the original detail as possible.</li> 
<br>
<li><u><b>Do not</b> add details that don't belong in WoW</u>. Sometimes the algorithm misses small details, so it is okay to add them to the map. However, you should not add details that are inconsistent with the original World of Warcraft map.</li> 
<br>
<li><u><b>Do not</b> make inconsistent edits</u>. If you change one part of the map, try to make similar changes elsewhere. Two buildings that are similar in World of Warcraft should also be similar in the Minecraft map.</li> 
<br>
<li><u><b>Do not</b> use strange materials</u>. Make changes using block types from the surrounding area. Use other blocks sparingly.</li>
<br>
<li><u><b>Do not</b> use bedrock as a construction material</u>. It has special properties and is needed by the post-processing algorithm.</li>
<br>
<li><u><b>Do not</b> attempt to edit waterfalls</u>. You will only mess them up.</li>

</ul>

<h2>DO:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Improve map aesthetics by filling in gaps in the terrain, smoothing out rough edges, and improving building symmetry.</li> 
<li>Improve map accessibility by widening doors and hallways that are too small to navigate and adding stairs where appropriate.</li> 
<li>Inspect different parts of the Minecraft map to ensure aesthetic consistency between various locations.</li> 
<li>Add relevant and interesting details to the map, such as flower pots, chests, bookshelves, signs and other features that are consistent with the original World of Warcraft environment.</li>  
<li>Log in to an active World of Warcraft account to compare the Minecraft map against the real thing. You do not need to be a paid subscriber to do this (you can sign up for a free account).</li>

</ul>
