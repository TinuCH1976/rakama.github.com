<h2>DO NOT:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Do not alter the alignment of structures. Some buildings are placed at odd angles while others are not. This is the reality of the map. Do not attempt to change this by rebuilding structures at a 90 degree angle. Instead, preserve the existing alignment of the buildings and make other changes to improve building aesthetics.</li> 

<li>Do not remove details from the map. Some objects are poorly rendered by the algorithm, but you should not remove these details. Instead, you should try to improve the appearance of the mapwhile preserving as much of the original detail as possible.</li> 

<li>Do not add details to the map that do not exist in World of Warcraft. Sometimes the algorithm misses small details, so it is okay to add them to the Minecraft map. However, you should not add details that are inconsistent with the original World of Warcraft map.</li> 

<li>Do not make inconsistent edits. If change one part of the map, try to make similar changes elsewhere. If two buildings are similar in World of Warcraft, they should also be similar in the Minecraft map.</li> 

<li>Do not use strange materials. You should make changes using block types from the surrounding area. Use different blocks sparingly.</li>

<li>Do not use bedrock as a construction material. It has special proeprties</li>

</ul>

<h2>DO:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Improve map aesthetics by filling in gaps in the terrain, smoothing out rough edges, and improving building symmetry.</li> 

<li>Improve map accessibility by widening doors and hallways that are too small to navigate and adding stairs where appropriate.</li> 

<li>Add relevant details such as flower pots, chests, bookshelves, signs and other features that are consistent with the original World of Warcraft map.</li>  

<li>Inspect different parts of the Minecraft map to ensure aesthetic consistency between various locations.</li> 

</ul>
